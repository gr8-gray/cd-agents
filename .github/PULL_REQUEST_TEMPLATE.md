13 Layers to Production — merge gate.
Score every APPLICABLE layer. Mark N/A with a reason (a local backend has no CDN, etc.).
The Opus merge reviewer must not approve while an applicable, critical layer is ❌ missing.
Security (8) and Auth (4) are near-always critical.

## What & why
<!-- One or two sentences: what this change does and the problem it solves. -->

## Verified locally
<!-- Commands run + result — evidence, not assertions (tests, build, manual exercise). -->

## Rollback / blast radius
<!-- How this reverts if it goes wrong; what breaks if it fails; is it behind the auto-rollback rails? -->

## Secrets / config
<!-- New env/secrets by NAME only (STOP 21 — never values). Where set (hosting env / GH Actions secrets). -->
